# GBCB Seminar Presentation 1

First of two presentatinos for my [GBCB](http://gbcb.vbi.vt.edu/gbcb/about_program) requrement:

GBCB 5004 : Seminar in Genetics, Bioinformatics, and Computational Biology.
Students in the program will be required to register for seminar every semester.
Most semesters, students will register on a pass-fail basis, but during their course of study, at least 2 formal presentations must be given and graded on an A-F basis.
Note that the dissertation defense seminar does not count as one of these two presentations
